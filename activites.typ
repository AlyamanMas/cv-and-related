= Internships

== Internship at Intelligile #text(weight: "regular")[\/ Core Engineering Team Member]
#text(rgb("#444"))[Summer 2022]

In this internship, I joined the Core Engineering Team and worked together on 
creating a cross-platform 3D engine that maps to different APIs on each 
platform (we worked with DirectX on Windows, Metal on macOS, and Vulkan for 
  Linux). I learned many cooperation skills as this was a long practical 
internship, and I picked many technical skills from working on a very low-
level project and having long discussions with my amazing mentor.

= Volunteering

== SWIM LEBANON #text(weight: "regular")[\/ Volunteering Member]
#text(rgb("#444"))[Spring 2022]

This was an event/opportunity organized by SWIM LEBANON where many of us gathered around the beach in Tripoli, Lebanon,
and started cleaning it. By the end, we filled around 100 big trash cans, and the beach around Beirut Arab University and
the surrounding area became much cleaner.

== Alnajah Charitable Organization #text(weight: "regular")[\/ Volunteering Member]
#text(rgb("#444"))[2022]

This was a charitable organization that I was a part of in Lebanon.
I participated in two events:
1. A visit to a refugee camp where we also donated clothes and food
2. An orphanage visit where we spent the day with the orphans and brought them gifts

== HelpClub #text(weight: "regular")[\/ Volunteering Member]
#text(rgb("#444"))[Fall 2022-Ongoing]

HelpClub is a charity club in AUC. I have been a part of this club since I joined this
University, and participated in packing events in addition to orphan visits.

= Student Organizations

== Open Source Community (OSC) #text(weight: "regular")[\/ President]
#text(rgb("#444"))[Spring 2024-Ongoing]

I am currently serving as the president of the Open Source Community club at AUC (OSC for short).
I have always been an active member of this club, but being a president has significantly shifted my
leadership skills and gave me an overview of what goes into organizing a complicated entity overall,
from event organization, to contacts/PR, financials, marketing...
